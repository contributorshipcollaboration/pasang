# pasang
The _pasang_ browser extension helps researchers automatically upload information regarding the authors of a manuscript in bulk on a scientific journal’s submission website (JMS or journal management system). Currently, most JMSes only offer HTML forms to submit this information, making the process cumbersomely manual and error-prone, especially for papers with many authors. The _pasang_ browser extension allows researchers to expedite this process by automatically filling out the forms on the journal’s submission portals with the authors’ information that was collected and curated beforehand by using [tenzing](https://tenzing.club).

_pasang_ is named after the first Nepalese woman to reach the summit of Mount Everest.
